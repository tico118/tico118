# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ernesto Ruiz. You can call me **Tico** \
I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with experience \
using Javascript, React.js, .NET/C#, and SQL.\

I'm a US Marine Corps veteran, who served as a \
Motor Transportation Diesel Mechanic. My experiences \
in the military, and in life, have developed a \
foundation of adaptability, leadership, perseverance, \
and communication in me. I greatly enjoy overcoming \
adversity, and solving problems.

I found that Software Development is the career field \
that truly challenges me and enriches my mind the way \
that I have always wanted.  I enjoy the constant \
problem-solving involved in the coding process and \
I strive to always be a great learner.
